This repo includes both the executable notebook and the exported pdf for ease of use. It also includes the VAD_model excel file 
(originally provided in class) and the generated Reddit data stored in a csv corpus for convenience. The executable notebook includes 
the cells that originally scraped the data as well as the code to access this csv file - only run the former if you are willing to wait a while,
as the Reddit API is slow.
