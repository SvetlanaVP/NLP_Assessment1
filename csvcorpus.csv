Wondering how that would work until Finland and Sweden are fully in NATO.

As in, if shit starts over Sweden and Finland, and Danish/Norwegian air assets get pulled in, does Article V get invoked when Danish/Norwegian targets start getting struck.

250 4th-Gen strike birds with stealth replacements in the future is a lot by modern standards though I think they are counting their chickens before they hatch (they are counting orders that are still being fulfilled), and the framework to work together, the infrastructure, shared logistics just multiplies that further. Even Sweden's homegrown defense industry is heavily compatible with NATO tech. Also, that is a lot of airspace they can roam over now. Would be interesting to see Swedish guerrilla air force doctrine spread out.

As of now, I count 186 4th/5th Gen fighters in those air forces in the Strike role, as in not counting Trainer aircraft that could absolutely be pushed into that role.

I just compare everything to US numbers, the service being my perspective. The combined Scandinavian Air Fleet is approximately four current Carrier Air Wings in striking power. That is a lot, considering that F-16 is continuously updated, the Finns have F-18s, the Norwegians are actively fielding F-35s already, and the Swedes' Gripen is absolutely a competitive warbird.

this however will. big finesse move of sweden to find the one way to solve this problem without having to do what they should have done to begin with, give the pilots fair pay and fair retirement benefits.

541,">President Joe Biden arrived in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv on Monday in an early morning surprise visit to underscore American support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and his war efforts against Russia, Rolling Stone has learned. Shrouded in secrecy, and coming days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, the trip marks the first time Biden has traveled to Ukraine as president. 

>Armed with billions of dollars’ worth of weapons from Western countries, and in desperate need for more, Ukraine has fought the Russians to a bloody standstill. Despite American sanctions and the devastating battlefield losses of people and equipment, Moscow continues its assault on Ukrainian defenses. 

>Multiple government agencies and officials in the U.S. and Ukraine did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone’s inquiries about Biden’s trip. A senior White House official and a U.S. government official with knowledge of the trip confirmed the visit on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

> President Joe Biden arrived in Ukraine&#039;s capital city of Kyiv on Monday in an early morning surprise visit to underscore American support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and his war efforts against Russia, Rolling Stone has learned.

> Shrouded in secrecy, and coming days before the first anniversary of Russia&#039;s invasion, the trip marks the first time Biden has traveled to Ukraine as president.

> Despite claims from the White House for Biden having &quot;No plans&quot; to cross into Ukraine during his trip to Poland, plans to cross the Polish-Ukraine border began more than a month ago, after Biden told staffers he wanted a public display to show solidarity between the United States and embattled Ukraine as it enters its second year of war.

Edit: Additional information on SafetyLabelType. It looks like it may not be in use anymore, but it has definitely been used for downranking.

> SafetyLabelType

> Describes a particular policy violation for a given noun instance, and usually leads to reduced visibility of the labeled entity in product surfaces. There are many deprecated, and experimental safety label types. Labels with these safety label types have no effect on VF. Additionally, some safety label types are not used, and not designed for VF.

Results are supposed to vary between users i think, but this is from what i can gather speaking from seeing my 'recommended' feed. I can look at it now and there are still 2 major Ukraine trending tabs.

Its probably for keeping Ukraine from chewing the Trending tab alive and keeping it contained to a few trending tabs.

925,">	Twitter user Aakash Gupta (@aakashg0) got together with a group of others to sift through the code for the algorithm and discovered the secrets to boosting your follower numbers on the site – as well as the fact that like topics judged to be “misinformation,” the topic of Ukraine is highly down-ranked.
    Anecdotally, Twitter users who post frequently on Ukraine topics had noticed less engagement with their accounts since Musk took over the platform in October last year. Musk’s own position on support for Ukraine is ambiguous.

There isn’t any further mention or substantiation in the article. No description of how, or to what extent, this is happening. They don’t even bother to quote the group who supposedly found this. Does anyone have any further information?

Edit: here is the Twitter user’s link that may have been the justification of this headline and article. It seems to be showing code that applies safety labels. It doesn’t explain how this means “posts about Ukraine” are “highly down-ranked”. It just says it happens.

932,"the Ukraine thing isn't great- and I say this as VERY pro Ukraine (lets give them even more military aid) and very anti-Kremlin.

The important thing to see here is how something  so important is manipulated for views. That should be the main takeaway, not that it's just about Ukraine, as important as that is. 

Humans have a HUGE bias towards things they've seen repeated 1000 times as being true. Half the ""LPT"" and advice and geopolitics arm chairing is literally people repeating shit they've heard on reddit. 

Which leads to my second point. People are far less likely to question and remember the source of something - but if you repeat it 100 times they'll start to remember it as 'true'. 

That's why clowns in politics repeat the same thing over and over even if it's not true. Thats why advertisements are about bombarding you with a point as many times as they possibly can.  That's why 24 hour news loves to repeat things. And it's why you and your best friend get into an argument over who came up with that witty one liner or joke and who's joke it was. 

You might remember trivia, joke, tidbit, political talking point, or LPT, but I can promise you 80% of the time you can't tell me where you first learned it other than some very vague guesses like ""um reddit...uh a friend, a book? the news?"". you probably couldn't tell me which friend, what book let alone where in it, what news source, or what user/link on reddit.

That's why manipulation social media is dangerous. it knows this and it's entire point is ""how can I show you this idea is popular(and hence true) by bombarding you with it over and over fast enough"" because then you'll repeat and then YOU'LL be someone else's ""not verified but good enough"" source for them to repeat it as truth.",2023-04-02 14:33:08,63,worldnews,Vahlir,comment,Analysis of Twitter algorithm code reveals social medium down-ranks tweets about Ukraine,"['ukraine', 'thing', ""n't"", 'great-', 'say', 'pro', 'ukraine', '(', 'let', 'give', 'even', 'military', 'aid', ')', 'anti-kremlin', '.', 'important', 'thing', 'see', 'something', 'important', 'manipulated', 'view', '.', 'main', 'takeaway', ',', ""'s"", 'ukraine', ',', 'important', '.', 'human', 'huge', 'bias', 'towards', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'repeated', '1000', 'time', 'true', '.', 'half', '``', 'lpt', ""''"", 'advice', 'geopolitics', 'arm', 'chairing', 'literally', 'people', 'repeating', 'shit', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'reddit', '.', 'lead', 'second', 'point', '.', 'people', 'far', 'le', 'likely', 'question', 'remember', 'source', 'something', '-', 'repeat', '100', 'time', ""'ll"", 'start', 'remember', ""'true"", ""'"", '.', ""'s"", 'clown', 'politics', 'repeat', 'thing', 'even', ""'s"", 'true', '.', 'thats', 'advertisement', 'bombarding', 'point', 'many', 'time', 'possibly', '.', ""'s"", '24', 'hour', 'news', 'love', 'repeat', 'thing', '.', ""'s"", 'best', 'friend', 'get', 'argument', 'came', 'witty', 'one', 'liner', 'joke', ""'s"", 'joke', 'wa', '.', 'might', 'remember', 'trivia', ',', 'joke', ',', 'tidbit', ',', 'political', 'talking', 'point', ',', 'lpt', ',', 'promise', '80', '%', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'first', 'learned', 'vague', 'guess', 'like', '``', 'um', 'reddit', '...', 'uh', 'friend', ',', 'book', '?', 'news', '?', ""''"", '.', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'friend', ',', 'book', 'let', 'alone', ',', 'news', 'source', ',', 'user/link', 'reddit', '.', ""'s"", 'manipulation', 'social', 'medium', 'dangerous', '.', 'know', ""'s"", 'entire', 'point', '``', 'show', 'idea', 'popular', '(', 'hence', 'true', ')', 'bombarding', 'fast', 'enough', ""''"", ""'ll"", 'repeat', ""'ll"", 'someone', 'else', ""'s"", '``', 'verified', 'good', 'enough', ""''"", 'source', 'repeat', 'truth', '.']",0.6175434980003278,0.5037489833671558,0.5963843969030725

This is how Whig historiography dies… if Progressive messages of equality and equity cannot be spread across the world, humanity cannot advance as a whole.

Because too many other humans in regressive Eastern nations could care less about advancing the development of humanity. They value tradition, order, and religion more highly than innovation and creativity.

The cycle repeats itself… seems like we can never break it.

The only way they could have come up with their %50 and %83 numbers from this data was count ""partial"" compliance as ""not approved"".   **The actual ""No action"" count for 2022 is %0.7**.

Just glancing at the data it's pretty clear that a lot of the ""partials"" shifts by country from 2022 to 2023.  India dropped from 43 to 2.  Korea dropped from 166 to 2, keeping the same ""yes"" count so far (8).  Interestingly, a lot more ""Yes"" from Germany, 65 to 210.  

Turkey actually has an above-average number of partials:

That's the kind of thing that the American Deep State and Foreign Intelligence Agencies really like to call countries it wants to go to war against. This article is a warning to India and Turkey not to get too friendly with Russia... whle the post is meant to introduce morons to the idea that Turkey and India might are potentially malign to American interests.

In effect this post is disinformation from American intel agencies fed by a very dedicated social media propagandist whose posts remarkably align with the American Democratic party (aka: The WAR PARTY).

*They've encouraged Finland/Sweden to want to join NATO (giving us the backing of the descendents of vikings) and increasing NATO border size massively.

*They've pushed us to breaking free from Russian energy.

*****
> Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Western countries Tuesday of igniting and sustaining the war in Ukraine, dismissing any blame for Moscow almost a year after the Kremlin&#039;s unprovoked invasion of its neighbor that has killed tens of thousands of people.

> Observers are expected to scour it for signs of how Putin sees the conflict, which has become bogged down, and what tone he might set for the year ahead. The Russian leader vowed no military let-up in Ukrainian territories he has illegally annexed, apparently rejecting any peace overtures in a conflict that has reawakened fears of a new Cold War.

> Putin accused the west of the West of launching &quot;Aggressive information attacks&quot; and taking aim at Russian culture, religion and values because it is aware that &quot;It is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield.""

They worked immediately to get the Ukrainian employees and their families out of Ukraine upon invasion. I love my company. I am proud to work here. In addition, they match donations for certain Ukraine funding and we have internal share point for Ukraine support. Upon the invasion there was a smart sheet where our employees from all over the world would open their homes, extra bedrooms, one bedroom flats to incoming refugees, it was so many people, and so many touching comments like, “it’s just a one bedroom but I am happy to share and I have a child who would play with your children if you have any, we live by a park in Poland” or “we have a farmhouse you are welcome to live there and bring all your animals.” Regardless of what people think about Cisco, the people of this company care about eachother and supporting its employees, and highlighting events in the US and around the world, encouraging people to speak up, do the right thing, give back and be the voice for others. Yes maybe not a drop in the bucket, but that was something they never highlighted. What they highlighted was how we could help our Ukrainian employees and help people who need it.

> Lithuania was sending Ukraine weapons even before Russia&#039;s invasion began last February, at a time when Ukraine was fighting Russian-backed separatists in its east.

> While Ukraine&#039;s other backers have given more offensive weapons to Ukraine as the war progressed, Lithuania is urging them to send still more, including granting Ukraine&#039;s request for fighter jets.

4209,"Thanks for sharing! Here's more from the article:

""Ukraine's allies should support Ukraine with whatever weapons it needs because Ukrainians are dying to protect Europe from Russia, Lithuania's prime minister said in an interview with Insider.

  
Ingrida Šimonytė spoke to Insider on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

  
She described Russia as a threat to Europe, and said Ukrainians are dying to protect the continent's security and should be given advanced offensive weaponry.

  
""We are not losing people. We're just losing some money. I say we are losing, \[but\] I think we are investing in a way, investing into our security,"" she said.

  
""The least thing we can do is to support Ukraine with anything it needs,"" she added.

  
Lithuania has been among Ukraine's strongest backers, and has advocated for giving the country advanced weapons, striking a much less cautious tone than many of its other allies.

  
Lithuania was sending Ukraine weapons even before Russia's invasion began last February, at a time when Ukraine was fighting Russian-backed separatists in its east.

  
Šimonytė said supporting Ukraine is an obvious human reaction, but also one that protects her country and Europe.

  
""It's sort of a cliche to say that Ukrainians are fighting this war for all of us,"" she added.

  
But ""it is a very practical thing because President Zelenskyy actually says that bluntly: that if you want to stop Russia at the borders of Ukraine, you better provide Ukraine with all the weapons that Ukrainian army needs, because otherwise there might be no end to the war in Europe for a very significant period of time,"" she told Insider.

  
Lithuania, like its neighbors Latvia and Estonia, was once part of the Soviet Union, but is now a member of NATO and the EU.

  
All three countries warned of the growing risk from Russia before its invasion of Ukraine started, and have boosted their own defenses since, believing Russia could turn to other European countries if it wins in Ukraine.",2023-02-24 17:18:36,5,worldnews,thisisinsider,comment,Lithuania's prime minister says Ukrainians should get all the weapons they want because they are dying for Europe's safety: 'We're just losing some money',"['thanks', 'sharing', '!', ""'s"", 'article', ':', ""''"", 'ukraine', ""'s"", 'ally', 'support', 'ukraine', 'whatever', 'weapon', 'need', 'ukrainian', 'dying', 'protect', 'europe', 'russia', ',', 'lithuania', ""'s"", 'prime', 'minister', 'said', 'interview', 'insider', '.', 'ingrida', 'šimonytė', 'spoke', 'insider', 'eve', 'one-year', 'anniversary', 'russia', ""'s"", 'invasion', 'ukraine', '.', 'described', 'russia', 'threat', 'europe', ',', 'said', 'ukrainian', 'dying', 'protect', 'continent', ""'s"", 'security', 'given', 'advanced', 'offensive', 'weaponry', '.', '``', 'losing', 'people', '.', ""'re"", 'losing', 'money', '.', 'say', 'losing', ',', '\\', '[', 'but\\', ']', 'think', 'investing', 'way', ',', 'investing', 'security', ',', ""''"", 'said', '.', '``', 'least', 'thing', 'support', 'ukraine', 'anything', 'need', ',', ""''"", 'added', '.', 'lithuania', 'ha', 'among', 'ukraine', ""'s"", 'strongest', 'backer', ',', 'ha', 'advocated', 'giving', 'country', 'advanced', 'weapon', ',', 'striking', 'much', 'le', 'cautious', 'tone', 'many', 'ally', '.', 'lithuania', 'wa', 'sending', 'ukraine', 'weapon', 'even', 'russia', ""'s"", 'invasion', 'began', 'last', 'february', ',', 'time', 'ukraine', 'wa', 'fighting', 'russian-backed', 'separatist', 'east', '.', 'šimonytė', 'said', 'supporting', 'ukraine', 'obvious', 'human', 'reaction', ',', 'also', 'one', 'protects', 'country', 'europe', '.', '``', ""'s"", 'sort', 'cliche', 'say', 'ukrainian', 'fighting', 'war', 'u', ',', ""''"", 'added', '.', '``', 'practical', 'thing', 'president', 'zelenskyy', 'actually', 'say', 'bluntly', ':', 'want', 'stop', 'russia', 'border', 'ukraine', ',', 'better', 'provide', 'ukraine', 'weapon', 'ukrainian', 'army', 'need', ',', 'otherwise', 'might', 'end', 'war', 'europe', 'significant', 'period', 'time', ',', ""''"", 'told', 'insider', '.', 'lithuania', ',', 'like', 'neighbor', 'latvia', 'estonia', ',', 'wa', 'part', 'soviet', 'union', ',', 'member', 'nato', 'eu', '.', 'three', 'country', 'warned', 'growing', 'risk', 'russia', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'started', ',', 'boosted', 'defense', 'since', ',', 'believing', 'russia', 'could', 'turn', 'european', 'country', 'win', 'ukraine', '.']",0.569505480373575,0.5708794206024213,0.5430679641516327
